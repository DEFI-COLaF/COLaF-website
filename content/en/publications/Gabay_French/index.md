abstract: 'The 17th c. is crucial for the French language, as it sees the creation of a strict orthographic norm that largely persists to this day. Despite its significance, the history of spelling systems remains however an overlooked area in linguistics for two reasons. On the one hand, spelling is made up of microchanges which requires a quantitative approach, and on the other hand, no corpus is available due to the interventions of editors in almost all the texts already available. In this paper, we therefore propose a new corpus allowing such a study, as well as the extraction and analysis tools necessary for our research. By comparing the text extracted with OCR and a version automatically aligned with contemporary French spelling, we extract the variant zones, we categorise these variants, and we study their frequency to study the (ortho)graphic change during the 17th century.
