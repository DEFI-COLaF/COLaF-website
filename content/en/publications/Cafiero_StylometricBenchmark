abstract: 'Is age a lethal weapon for authorship verification? While writers' style is known to measurably evolve, most computational pipelines still treat style as time-invariant. Building on recent work that tracks idiolectal drift in several traditions, we introduce the first controlled benchmark that quantifies how both the magnitude and the direction of temporal distance affect attribution. A diachronic corpus of French novelists is sampled at bidirectional gaps of ±1, ±5, ±10 and ±15 years. Verification is then tested with a generative Bootstrap Distance Impostors (BDI) model and a discriminative linear Support-Vector Machine (SVM). Results expose a near-linear loss of confidence as the gap widens, but -critically -also reveal a systematic directional asymmetry: late-career texts remain recognisable from early-career references, whereas early texts are markedly harder to verify against late ones, suggesting cumulative rather than substitutive stylistic change. The pattern persists under random-pair controls, confirming that it is not a sampling artefact. All code, data and evaluation scripts are released to encourage further research on temporally robust authorship analysis and to reassess the default assumption of a fixed stylistic "fingerprint."'
