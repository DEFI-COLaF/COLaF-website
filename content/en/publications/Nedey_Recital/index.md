abstract: 'We present a state of the art of machine translation and its evaluation for languages with dialectal variation, and in particular for dialect continua. To accompany this overview, we propose a series of preliminary experiments working with the Occitan continuum, in order to assess the performance of existing systems with respect to translation from and into several varieties of Occitan. Our results indicate that translation into French and English is generally of good quality. Analyses combined with language identification tools applied to predictions into Occitan highlight the ability of most of the systems tested to generate texts in this language (even in zero-shot settings), but they also reveal limitations in terms of evaluation methods for the dialectal diversity in the proposed translations.'
